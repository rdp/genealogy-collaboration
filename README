A wiki would be a great tool for collaboration because discussions doesn't, for example, allow one to share a "todo" list about a person, for collaboration.  Though a step in the right direction.  +1 for wiki's per person, for adding stories about them, sharing lists, etc.



The 17th link or so was to *our page* LOL.

Maybe it needs a hierarchy?

Probably want johnpack.genealogy-collaboration.inet2.org

Maybe have that as the main site, which points out to 
the various sub-sites, and also to a "random" site.
  "You can get your own specific sub-site, just ask"

Need chris' input on this :)
And also that guy.
And g-ma
and melissa?


could research this more:
https://www.familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/NGS2010X

Also could the wiki have an "updates" email?
$wgUsersNotifiedOnAllChanges (formerly $wgUsersNotifedOnAllChanges!) - Array of usernames who will be sent a notification email for every change which occurs on a wiki

The wiki must allow for 


To ask them: mailing list? updates mailing list?

Anti-spam! Yikes!

Google sites has wikis?
  nice uncluttered interface.
  It needs anonymous edits or we are toast.  Indeed.

FAcebook integration somehow?

our family oligy seems pay

ever note? google docs?

dropbox/box.net ?

A "family tree" view that ties them in with new familysearch somehow? :)


footnote.com-style mechanism [?A -- fold3

werelate seems like its own online wikitree...hmm...but you can search by name...hmm...

  Do we want a grande todo list or todo list by person?
  do we want gootnote.com style for notes about a person?  Tie footnote into new familysearch?

wikitree would seem to duplicate new.familysearch info...hmm...A

Maybe my own fold3? To complement new familysearch?

are discussions live yet? [can you subscribe to them? a tree of them?]
