= todo =

genealogy.tk
  can it have subdomains?


can inet22.net have NS servers, and then somehow work OOTB with BH?
  if so, subscribe afraid.org, just use screencast [move this to other]


= maybe =

the massive universal bugzilla!


A wiki would be a great tool for collaboration because discussions doesn't, for example, allow one to share a "todo" list about a person, for collaboration.  Though a step in the right direction.  +1 for wiki's per person, for adding stories about them, sharing lists, etc.

TODO: on gc.inet2.org note "here's an example" and "here's universal" one and "here's full list"

mediawiki: I will contribute a patch for your tree like structure! plz?

The 17th link or so was to *our page* LOL.

Maybe it needs a hierarchy?
bugzilla? somehow?

Probably want johnpack.genealogy-collaboration.inet2.org

Maybe have that as the main site, which points out to 
the various sub-sites, and also to a "random" site.
  "You can get your own specific sub-site, just ask"

Need chris' input on this :)
And also that guy.
And g-ma
and melissa?


could research this more:
https://www.familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/NGS2010X

Also could the wiki have an "updates" email?
$wgUsersNotifiedOnAllChanges (formerly $wgUsersNotifedOnAllChanges!) - Array of usernames who will be sent a notification email for every change which occurs on a wiki

The wiki must allow for 


To ask them: mailing list? updates mailing list?

Anti-spam! Yikes!

Google sites has wikis?
  nice uncluttered interface.
  It needs anonymous edits or we are toast.  Indeed.

FAcebook integration somehow?

our family oligy seems pay

ever note? google docs?

dropbox/box.net ?

A "family tree" view that ties them in with new familysearch somehow? :)


footnote.com-style mechanism [?A -- fold3

werelate seems like its own online wikitree...hmm...but you can search by name...hmm...
  seems like...this duplicate new family tree?

  Do we want a grande todo list or todo list by person?
  do we want gootnote.com style for notes about a person?  Tie footnote into new familysearch?

wikitree would seem to duplicate new.familysearch info...hmm...A

Maybe my own fold3? To complement new familysearch?

are discussions live yet? [can you subscribe to them? a tree of them?]

screencastss/http://ancestryerrors.wikia.com/wiki/How_to_Add_a_Page_to_this_Wiki

so far I'm liking wikia or my own :P (maybe put the two together, demo them)

familypursuit is private only? yeck... and $60/year


http://lythgoes.net/genealogy/software.php costs

sharing time costs

iTODO gc: "I can add any tool you want/think would be useful"



family search "events" don't cut it for stories, since they only allow for life events, basically, on their timeline.

http://getsatisfaction.com/familysearch/topics/encourage_the_creation_of_wiki_pages_for_persons_and_have_links_to_the_tree_and_vice_versa :
  A wiki would be a great tool for collaboration because discussions doesn't, for example, allow one to share a "todo" list about a person, for collaboration. Though a step in the right direction. +1 for wiki's per person, for adding stories about them, sharing lists, etc.

being able to subscribe to "discussions for him and all ancestors" would work...hope they let you...hmm...this won't hurt LOL

http://www.biographicalwiki.com/index.php/Shirley_E._Moser_%281929-2010%29
  looks interesting, a somewhat biography on people...hmm...
  I *think* http://familypedia.wikia.com is the same... hmm...


generic forum people can add their own forums to?  Might not hurt much :P

It is true that wikia will be maintained/hosted after I'm long gone...hmm...
  maybe I should put/add it to the JPFA website itself, then? Self-hosted? hmm...
  TODO Ask Chris.
  

  hosted On the jpfa site itself?
  What wiki format do you like best?
  Does wikia have too many ads?
  Is this a good collaborative medium, do you think?
  Would a genealogy specific mailing list be useful to us?
  Have you had any experience using any genealogy collaboration tools before? Any feedback/what you liked/didn't like about them/what would be ideal/what would be your wish list about them? (sorry to pester with questions.

  could use Ancestry/Rootsweb message boards and the genforum message boards a
    except they're not publically viewable are they?

genforum/genealogy.com require new login


can "kind of" link to them: https://new.familysearch.org/en/action/recordnumbersearch?pid=KWC5-65Q

don't trust .tk yet :P though I guess if they email you to renew, and you have something that hits the sites for you LOL.

http://www.johnpackfamily.com/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I246&tree=1 still doesn't have a wiki feel really...
  poor display of cool sources! noooo...
