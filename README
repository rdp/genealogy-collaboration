The 17th link or so was to *our page* LOL.

Maybe it needs a hierarchy?

Probably want johnpack.genealogy-collaboration.inet2.org

Maybe have that as the main site, which points out to 
the various sub-sites, and also to a "random" site.
  "You can get your own specific sub-site, just ask"

Need chris' input on this :)
And also that guy.
And g-ma
and melissa?


could research this more:

Also could the wiki have an "updates" email?
$wgUsersNotifiedOnAllChanges (formerly $wgUsersNotifedOnAllChanges!) - Array of usernames who will be sent a notification email for every change which occurs on a wiki

The wiki must allow for 


To ask them: mailing list? updates mailing list?

Anti-spam! Yikes!

Google sites has wikis?
  nice uncluttered interface.
  It needs anonymous edits or we are toast.  Indeed.

FAcebook integration somehow?
